Amazon Product Studio is a fully optimized, credits-based SaaS application built for modern e-commerce sellers. It seamlessly handles User Authentication, Credits & Billing, Image Persistence, and asynchronous AI generation using a sleek Next.js (App Router) structure. It is designed to allow sellers and agencies to quickly test multiple background settings for their products without needing manual editing or photoshoots.

**Why use Amazon Product Studio?**

- **Production-Ready SaaS** — Complete with Google OAuth and Stripe Checkout workflows built-in.
- **Sleek Custom Dropdowns** — Upward-opening aspect ratio and preset selectors prevent clipping and scroll-chaining on all viewport screens.
- **Self-Healing AI Polling & Webhooks** — Uses MuAPI predictions API with fallback status checking during fetches (`GET /api/creations`), ensuring local development works without external tunnels.
- **Personal Creation History** — Keep track of previous creatives in the inline dashboard gallery or the dedicated `/gallery` route.
- **Responsive Screen-Fitting** — Designed with a fluid layout that fits perfectly on all screens (mobile, tablet, desktop) using stacked adaptive grids on mobile and viewport-locked scrolling on desktop.

## ⚡ Deployment: Vercel & Production

This architecture is engineered explicitly for **Vercel** serverless environments.

### One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/amazon-product-studio)

**Live App:** [amazon-product-studio.vercel.app](https://amazon-product-studio.vercel.app/)

### 🔑 Required Environment Variables

To successfully deploy and run, you must populate the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

| Service | Variable | Description & Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string ([Supabase](https://supabase.com) or [Neon](https://neon.tech)) |
| **NextAuth / Google** | `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Secure random string generated via `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| | `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Your production domain (e.g. `https://amazon-product-studio.vercel.app`) |
| | `WEBHOOK_URL` | Public URL for MuAPI async callbacks (same as `NEXTAUTH_URL` in production) |
| | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) |
| | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) |
| **Stripe Billing** | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Get from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) |
| | `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Get from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) |
| | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook secret for resolving credit purchases |
| **AI Generation** | `MUAPIAPP_API_KEY` | Create an account and get key from [muapi.ai/access-keys](https://muapi.ai/access-keys) |

### 🚀 Launching on Vercel: Step-by-Step

1. **Database Provisioning**: Create a new Postgres database (via Supabase or Neon). Retrieve the connection string (`DATABASE_URL`).
2. **Project Creation**: Import your GitHub fork into the Vercel dashboard.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Copy the variables above into the Vercel project settings environment tab.
4. **Deploy**: Hit "Deploy". Vercel will automatically run the build steps (`npm run build`).
5. **Database Push**: Run `npx prisma db push` to synchronize database models before launching.
6. **Integrations Setup**:
   - Establish a **Google Cloud OAuth app**, enabling the callback URL: `https://amazon-product-studio.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Setup a **Stripe Webhook**, pointing to `https://amazon-product-studio.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook` and selecting the `checkout.session.completed` event.
   - Register a **MuAPI Webhook** pointing to `https://amazon-product-studio.vercel.app/api/webhooks/ai` to receive async generation results.

## 🛠️ Local Development

Ready to iterate locally? Setup is straightforward.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- A local PostgreSQL instance or a free cloud Database URL.
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) (optional, for local MuAPI webhook testing)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/amazon-product-studio
cd amazon-product-studio

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Setup Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and insert your specific keys.

# 4. Initialize Database Schema
# Note: Because the database is shared, see the Safety Warning below!
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# 5. Start the Development Server
npm run dev
```

The console should now be active on `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Webhook Tip:** For local MuAPI webhook testing, run `ngrok http 3000` and set `WEBHOOK_URL` to the generated HTTPS URL in your `.env`.

## ⚠️ Database Safety Warning (Shared Pool)

The workspace database is shared with other applications. Running `npx prisma db push` on a clean, empty schema will drop tables belonging to other applications. Always follow the **Pull-Declare-Push-Cleanup** sequence detailed in the [SaaS Application Blueprint Guide](../blueprint.md):

1. Run `npx prisma db pull` to fetch all database tables.
2. Declare your `Creation` table and update the relations on the `User` model.
3. Run `npx prisma db push` to add your changes safely.
4. Clean up `schema.prisma` to keep only NextAuth models, `Creation`, and the updated `User` relations.
5. Run `npx prisma generate` to rebuild the type-safe client.
